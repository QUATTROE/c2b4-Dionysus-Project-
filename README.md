Poker is a game where people gamble large amounts of money in order to win more money. The way poker is won is by having a stronger set of cards than your opponents. In poker, you normally create a combination of 5 cards. The probabilities of each winning combination happening can easily be found on wikipedia. To differentiate our project from the one we can find in wikipedia, we will instead find the probabilities of getting a winning combination given the first 2 cards we were dealt with. This is important as in Texas holdem, a variation of poker, 2 cards are given to the player and 3 cards are to be revealed later. We will calculate the probabilities of getting a royal straight flush, straight, 4 of a kind, 3 of a kind, and full house given our first 2 cards. The first 2 cards will be chosen from a dropdown menu. There will be 4 dropdown menus containing the values of the 2 cards. Of course we will have the face and the number. We will create buttons which the player will click on and these buttons will correspond to the different winning combinations. The probabilities of winning the chosen combination will be given in percentage form.

Here is the demo:
